# FreeTheTeacher
This personal project effort combined self-teaching of full-stack concepts with closing the gap on an evident need - the presence of an affordable modular and customized solution to fit educators classroom needs starting from an administrative capacity and evolving over time to best accomodate new feature requests.

# Technologies Used
* VS Code (editor)
    * I chose to use VS Code as my choice of editor due to its lightweight nature and support of most languages I might utilize in the project efforts
* Python (py) - v3.9.13
    * I chose to use Python as the application language due to my familiarity with it and recent in-depth study efforts.
* Markdown (md)
    * I chose to use Markdown for documentation efforts due to its ease of hosting alongside the code for the project in GitHub
* GitHub Version Control System (vcs)
    * I chose to use GitHub as my V.C.S. as it also hosts my other efforts allowing a consolidated view of my academic and personal coding efforts
* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/iy0D1hgQ/free-the-teacher) Project Management
    * I chose to use Trello as my project management system due to familiarity with the system and its cost effectiveness (free)
* Flask
    * I chose to use Flask as the web application framework due to its popularity as a simple method to deploying Python applications in a web format.
* Amazon Web Services (aws)
    * I chose to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the cloud database source to learn a new technology from the ground up (configuration, creation, management, maintenance, etc.).

# Requirements
The project can have necessary requirements met by running the following:
* `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Documentation
Documentation will be added later, likely in a GitHub Pages instance.

# Credits
At the moment, credit goes to my wife as the pilot user for this project. As I come across additional users/sources that I feel should be publicly commended, I'll update those here.
* My wife. Thank you for your time and energy as I spin up another project to suck away my free time.
